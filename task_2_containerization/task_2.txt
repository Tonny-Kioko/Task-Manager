1. Objective: Containerize the web application from Task 1. The Docker container should:
○ Expose the necessary ports
○ Include all dependencies
○ Be able to run the web application

OBJECTIVE 1: CREATING A DOCKER COMPOSE FILE
1. Since I will need multiple containers (database and logic), I created a docker-compose.yml file to execute these commands. 
2. All dependencies have been included in the files. 
3. I have tested the containers, and all the necessary ports are available and the application run successfully. 

NB: The files uploaded for the tasks are being uploaded to S3 as intended successfully
