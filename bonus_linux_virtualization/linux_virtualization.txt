Objective: Set up a virtual machine using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) or another hypervisor of
choice. The VM should:
○ Run a Linux-based operating system
○ Be accessible via SSH
○ Have appropriate resource allocations


I have created and run the virtual machine using the GUI. I chose this approach since it is simpler and easier to accomplish.
