Infrastructure as code allows for an automated deployment of resources. It is also easier to manage any created resources thus giving you more control. 
In this task, we aim to create various resources that will help run our Task Manager App. These include;
    - A Virtual Machine Instance
    - A VPC within which our resources will run. 
    - Security configuration to ensure the setup is secure. 

OBJECTIVE 1: CREATING A VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD(VPC) AND SUBNETS
1. Setting up the Networking components the first step since all the deployed resources will be running within them. 3
2. For the subnets, it is ideal to go with a smaller CIDR block to ensure as few IPs are available. This is especially since we will need a private subnet for the database. 
3. Make necessary security configuration
4. Include an Auto Scaling Group for the deployed resources
5. An S3 bucket with a life policy for the task images uploaded by the users
