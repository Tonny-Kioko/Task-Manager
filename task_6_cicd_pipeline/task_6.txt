CI/CD Pipeline with Cloud Integration (DevOps and Cloud Engineering)
- I will create a CI/CD pipeline using AWS Code Pipeline with the codebase imported from AWS Code Commit. 
    Code Build and Code Deploy will also be used at various steps in the process. 

OBJECTIVE 1: CREATING A CODECOMMIT REPOSITORY

1. Click on Code Commit and select the 'Create Repository' option. Once created, clone the repository locally. 
2. Create a Code Commit Username and Password on the IAM console. This ensures you can connect to the repository and push your changes through the HTTPS Git Credentials created. 
    - Save these as they cannot be accessed later on.
    * Alternatively, we can use GitHub as the code source since most of our pushes will go there. This is the approach I will be using for the project. 


OBJECTIVE 2: CREATING A BUILD PROJECT ON CODEBUILD
1. Enter a project name and a brief description
2. Select a primary source, in this case I will be using GitHub, select the Task-Manager repository and the main branch. 
3. Under the environment, select a Managed Image with the Ubuntu OS. Leave other options as default for simplicity.  
4. Create a new service role, this will be performed by AWS once this option is selected. 
5. Under the build specifications, select the buildspec.yml file option.
6. Made other configurations to make the pipeline run successfully. 

OBJECTIVE 3: S3 FOR ARTIFACT STORAGE
On successful builds, artifact files will be stored in an S3 bucket.
